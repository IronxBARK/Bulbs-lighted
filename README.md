So i just got this problem on yt.
That you are in a corridoor with 1000 bulbs, 1 person comes in and switch(on if off,off if on) the bulbs to his addition, like 1st one will on 1,2,3,4,5 ...
2nd will switch to off 2,4,6.....  and go on.
I got the answer on that if bulbs equal to person then the on will be perfect squares.
But i was unable to figure if there is unbalance. So i got after working some time... Easy though....:)
